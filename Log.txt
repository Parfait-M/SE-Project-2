Logs:

*Adam*
- Worked on the View
- Wrote the display functions for both games, display functions work with
Board of any size
- Wrote Unit Tests


*John*
- Started a little too late
- I had already written a nonogram board generator in javascript
  so I ported that over to Java
- I started to make a sudoku board generator, but saw that I didn't have enough
  time, so I just used a pre-backed generator to generated a few pre-made boards
- I saw that the updateBoard function that was defined for me didn't
  do any kind of input parsing and found that doing that kind of
  manipulation on a model level didn't work very well.
  
*Parfait*
- Had misconceptions about the Controller's responsabilities
- Called methods from both Model and View to interact with user and run the game
- Wrote a method to parse the user input and sent it to the model


*Zachary*
- Wrote a function to prompt for and get user input.
- Wrote a function to generated hints for the Nonogram game
- Added a unit test for that function ^
